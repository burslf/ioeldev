## Welcome to my social media :)

### Live example of the app =>> https://twi-twi.netlify.app/

Project made with React and Firebase

(There is some comments in my code but that's because I'm working on adding comments to each tweets.)

My social media has the follow features:
  * Editing your profile on settings, you can set : username, profil pic, bio, new password
  * Writing a post
  * Display posts made by user in its profile page
  * Display full size picture when clicking on it (on the profile page) 
  * Following users et get followers
  * Like/Unlike posts

I used moment.js for timing the posts (X min ago/X hours ago).
